# Power-BI-Dashboard-Creation---Terrorism-Database

Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset Terrorism
Terrorist attacks have become a serious source of risk affecting the security of the international community. Using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), in order to quantitatively study past terrorist attacks and their temporal and spatial evolution the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to classify the degree of damage from terrorist attacks. The various factors influencing terrorist attacks were extracted and represented in three dimensions.


1. Data Preparation:

- Import the Terrorism Database into Power BI.
- Clean the data to handle missing values and outliers.
- Ensure that the data types are correctly assigned.

2. Data Visualization:

- Create visualizations that display the number of terrorist attacks over time.
- Visualize attack locations on a map.
- Analyze trends in attack types and weapons used.
- Compare casualties by region or year.

3. Interactive Dashboard:

- Build an interactive dashboard with slicers, filters, and drill-through options.
- Allow users to explore the data dynamically.

4. Narrative and Insights:

- Provide a brief narrative that explains the key findings from your analysis.
- Offer insights into global terrorism trends.
- Include a summary of the most affected regions and the impact of terrorism
over time.

5. User-Friendly Design:

- Ensure that your dashboard is user-friendly and intuitive.
- Use appropriate color schemes and layouts for clarity.
